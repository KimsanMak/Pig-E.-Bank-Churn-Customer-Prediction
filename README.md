# Pig-E.-Bank-Churn-Customer-Prediction
## Overview
This repository contains some examples of Python scripts that I used to predict churn customer of Pig E. Bank. 

## Objective
Assessed the reasons customers are leaving the bank, and make prediction on who might leave so that better customer retention measures can be implemented.

Key questions to be answered:
1. Who are our customers?
2. Can we create customer segmentation? 
3. Can we predict what type of customer might leave the bank?
4. How can we improve our customer retention?

## Data
The [Pig E. Bank client data](https://images.careerfoundry.com/public/courses/data-immersion/A5/E5.4/5.4-PigEBank-Client-Data%20set.xlsx)  was provided by CareerFoundry.

## Tools
The analysis was conducted using Python with the following libraries:
+ Matplotlib: creating charts e.g. bar, pie, line, histogram and scatterplot
+ Numpy: performing mathematical operations on arrays
+ Pandas: organizing data into rows and columns making it easy to clean, analyze, and manipulate data
+ Seaborn: creating charts e.g. bar, pie, line, histogram and scatterplot
+ SciPy: broader spectrum of scientific tools, algorithms, and functions
+ sklearn: provides unsupervised and supervised learning algorithms
